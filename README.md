`alat` is a cross-platform, peer-to-peer device communication and orchestration framework written in Rust. It aims to provide a robust, decentralized way for devices (Mobile, Desktop, TV, and Embedded) to discover each other and communicate securely on a local network.

## 🚀 Overview

The project is built with a focus on reliability and performance, utilizing a multi-layered discovery strategy and a clean separation of concerns between its core logic, platform-specific implementations, and the user interface.

### Key Features

*   **Hybrid Discovery:** Combines mDNS (standard), UDP Broadcast (robust fallback), and manual pairing (QR code/phrase) for reliable peer discovery in various network environments (including hotspots).
*   **Cross-Platform UI:** Built with [Slint](https://slint.dev/), providing a lightweight and fast native user interface for desktop and potentially mobile/embedded platforms.
*   **High-Performance Core:** Powered by [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) for asynchronous networking and [gRPC (Tonic)](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic) for efficient, typed communication.
*   **Decentralized Architecture:** No central server required; devices communicate directly with each other.
*   **Secure by Design:** Includes a security layer for device pairing and encrypted communication.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

The project is organized into three main crates:

*   **`nlem` (Network Layer...):** The core library containing:
    *   **Node Logic:** Manages the lifecycle and state of an `alat` node.
    *   **Discovery Manager:** Handles mDNS and UDP broadcast for finding peers.
    *   **Services:** Implements gRPC services for pairing and telemetry.
    *   **Storage:** Manages local configuration and paired device data (YAML-based).
    *   **Security:** Handles device authentication and secure tokens.
*   **`platform`:** A platform abstraction layer that provides a unified interface for OS-specific tasks (networking, storage locations, etc.).
*   **`app`:** The Slint-based user interface application that orchestrates the `nlem` core and `platform` layer.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

*   **Language:** Rust (Edition 2024)
*   **Asynchronous Runtime:** `tokio`
*   **Serialization/RPC:** `prost` (Protobuf) & `tonic` (gRPC)
*   **UI Framework:** `slint`
*   **Configuration:** `serde` & `serde_yaml`

## 🚦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (latest stable version)
*   [Slint compiler](https://slint.dev/docs/rust/getting_started) (often handled by `cargo`)
